# SIG Life-cycle
 
SIGs exist so members of the community can discuss some of Spinnaker’s core feature areas, and guide design in those areas.

* SIGs are created as needed
* Each SIG has one or more “leads”, who own the SIG’s agenda
* Anyone can attend a SIG meeting

Have a proposal for a SIG? It's easy! We ask that you create a PR within this repository; please include a README which provides: 

* A description - what are the goals of the SIG? What's the scope of work? 
* Proposed SIG Leads
* Proposed Meeting Cadence

The project's Steering Committee and Technical Oversight Committee will review the PR. The ultimate approval or rejection of the proposal is the responsibility of the Steering Committee.
